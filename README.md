# M.A.D. App (My Awesome Day)

### The Problem
The Problem is either not knowing what to do, wanting to break the norm locally, or find out what is going on in a particular city that you might be visiting.  A problem I see with travel apps is that they are based on advertisement for the establishment.  Social apps are too focused on getting likes and not about how the experience was or how it fit into your day.  

### The Solution
MAD App is designed to find out what is happening where you are or are going.    The idea is to see REAL descriptions and REAL evidence of what people did and how they felt about it. With the MAD App photo displays, it’s also fun to create your events, and link them together to show the people just how awesome your day was.
